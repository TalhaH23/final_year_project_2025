<h1>Systematic Review Summaries</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Systematic reviews are fundamental to evidence-based healthcare.</li>
  <li>The methodology of systematic reviews has evolved to address diverse questions in health and medical sciences.</li>
  <li>This paper discusses the importance of selecting the appropriate type of systematic review based on the research question or priority, a concept often overlooked by novice authors and in existing literature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Systematic reviews are considered the gold standard for gathering, evaluating, and summarizing the best available evidence related to clinical questions.</li>
  <li>They provide a solid evidence base that supports the development of reliable clinical guidelines and aids in clinical decision-making.</li>
  <li>Systematic reviews follow a structured research process with rigorous methods to ensure the reliability and relevance of their results to end users, making them a cornerstone of evidence-based healthcare.</li>
  <li>The methodology of reviews in healthcare has evolved significantly since their initial use in the 1970s and 1980s.</li>
  <li>This evolution has caused confusion among researchers due to the variety of review types and the terminology used to describe them.</li>
  <li>Challenges primarily relate to the types of questions posed by researchers and the types of evidence used to address these questions.</li>
  <li>Systematic reviews traditionally focus on assessing the effectiveness of health interventions.</li>
  <li>These reviews primarily analyze and summarize findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</li>
  <li>Health professionals consider a variety of questions beyond the effectiveness of interventions, reflecting diverse research approaches in health care.</li>
  <li>Pearson and colleagues advocate for a pluralistic approach to evidence in health care, recognizing that not all questions are answered solely through studies focused on effectiveness.</li>
  <li>The evolution of systematic review methods has paralleled advances in the types of questions aimed at providing optimal evidence-based care.</li>
  <li>Systematic reviews traditionally focus on the effectiveness of medical interventions but have expanded to include various types addressing different healthcare and policy needs.</li>
  <li>The diversity of systematic review types can be confusing for novice reviewers.</li>
  <li>Novice reviewers often inappropriately apply the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) to reviews that do not concern direct effectiveness.</li>
  <li>The article discusses the challenges of fitting research questions into the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), particularly when the question involves diagnostic test accuracy or prognosis.</li>
  <li>The aim of the article is to propose a typology of systematic review types that align with different review questions, intended to assist novice systematic reviewers, editors, peer-reviewers, and policymakers.</li>
  <li>This article claims to be the first to classify types of systematic reviews based on their focus.</li>
  <li>Systematic reviews of etiology and risk are crucial for guiding healthcare planning and resource allocation, especially for decision-makers in health policy and prevention strategies.</li>
  <li>The primary goal of these reviews is to assess the presence and extent of a relationship between an exposure and a health outcome.</li>
  <li>The PEO mnemonic is recommended for structuring the review question, which should detail the exposure, disease, symptom or health condition, the affected populations or groups, and the relevant context/location, time period, and duration.</li>
  <li>Highlights the importance of formulating a specific, focused question for systematic reviews to guide search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data interpretation.</li>
  <li>Discusses the challenges faced by novice researchers in determining the type of review needed, conceptualizing the review question, and selecting appropriate methods for analysis and synthesis.</li>
  <li>Emphasizes the critical importance of a well-formed review question in the systematic review process.</li>
  <li>The popularity of systematic reviews has led to the development of various evidence review processes over the past three decades.</li>
  <li>Types of reviews include integrative reviews, scoping reviews, evidence maps, realist syntheses, rapid reviews, umbrella reviews, mixed methods reviews, and concept analyses.</li>
  <li>Typologies of these review types serve as useful references for researchers, policy makers, and funders in selecting an appropriate review approach.</li>
  <li>The focus of the discussed article is specifically on systematic review questions, not on describing each evidence synthesis method in detail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying the question and type of systematic review is crucial in the evidence-based healthcare paradigm, influencing the entire review process and other aspects of the evidence cycle.</li>
  <li>This step is often overlooked by novice reviewers and those unfamiliar with the various types of reviews available.</li>
  <li>The goal is to offer a typology of review types and outline essential elements to consider during the question development phase for each review type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A typology of various systematic review methodologies is proposed.</li>
  <li>Review types are defined and aligned with corresponding questions and inclusion criteria.</li>
  <li>The goal is to offer clear guidance for both novice and experienced reviewers and establish a unified typology for review types.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Review Typology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Defines a systematic review as a robust, reproducible, structured critical synthesis of existing research.</li>
  <li>Excludes other evidence synthesis approaches like literature reviews, evidence maps, rapid reviews, integrative reviews, scoping, and umbrella reviews unless they meet the systematic review criteria.</li>
  <li>Identifies ten different types of systematic review foci, emphasizing the importance of formulating a clear question for each review type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Systematic Reviews</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Systematic reviews are predominantly focused on assessing the effectiveness of interventions or therapies.</li>
  <li>Effectiveness refers to the degree to which an intervention achieves its intended effect when used as intended.</li>
  <li>The PICO approach is commonly used for developing questions in systematic reviews, which involves considering Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes.</li>
  <li>Key factors to consider in systematic reviews include demographic and socioeconomic aspects of the population, variations in the intervention's dosage, delivery mode, and timing, as well as the nature of the comparator (active or passive) and detailed plans for measuring outcomes, including timing and type of outcomes (primary and secondary, benefits and harms).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experiential (Qualitative) Reviews</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on analyzing human experiences and cultural and social phenomena.</li>
  <li>Often explore the engagement between participants and interventions, emphasizing the perspectives of individuals within a larger phenomenon.</li>
  <li>Useful for explaining why interventions may or may not be effective from a person-centered viewpoint.</li>
  <li>Help in understanding reasons behind the non-adoption of interventions despite proven effectiveness.</li>
  <li>Provide insights into patient experiences, aiding health professionals in improving care delivery.</li>
</ul>
