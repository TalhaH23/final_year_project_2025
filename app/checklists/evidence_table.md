| **Authors:**      | **Source population/s:**   | **Method of allocation:**                         | **Outcomes:**                          | Report results for all relevant outcomes: | Limitations identified by author: | TBC with CPHE team for each topic. |
| **Year:**         | Report the following:      | Describe how the selected individuals /clusters were allocated to intervention or control groups. | Include details of all relevant outcome measures and whether measures are objective or subjective or otherwise validated. | Confirm with CPHE but examples include mean values, confidence intervals, p values, standard deviations, standard errors, effect size, odds ratios, relative risks or any other relevant statistical detail reported by the original study authors. | Limitations identified by review team: | If authors report raw data, but have not calculated additional measures of effect size (e.g. NNT, OR, RR etc), if requested by CPHE the review teams should do this using standard formulae (clearly referenced) and report the results in this column. |
| **Citation:**     | Country of study (include if developed or non-developed, if systematic review with multiple countries state 'international') | State if not reported. | **Follow-up periods:** | Note any results that detail impact on health inequalities. | **Evidence gaps and/or recommendations for future research noted by study author:** | Where review teams are calculating from raw study data, the result/figure should be noted as ‘Reviewer Calculation’ then abbreviated and bracketed to ‘(RC)’, to indicate they have not been calculated by the original study authors. |
| **Country of study:** | Setting (public or private healthcare system, primary schools, community centres etc.) | Report how confounding minimised or state if not reported. | **Method of analysis:** | **Total sample:** Baseline Follow-up (all time points) End-point | **Source of funding:** For example, government (NHS), voluntary/charity, pharmaceutical company and the role of funding organisations. | **For example:** <br> Effect size 0.32(RC) <br> NNT 4(RC) <br> Odds ratio 1:2(RC) |
| **Aim of study:** | Location (urban, rural) | **Intervention/s description:** Describe intervention in detail including: <br> - what was delivered <br> - by whom <br> - to whom <br> - how delivered <br> - when/where <br> - how often <br> - how long for etc. | Indicate if ITT or completer analysis was used and if adjustments were made for any baseline differences in important confounders. | | | |
| **Study design:** | Sample characteristics, including population demographics⁵ (report age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, place of residence, occupation, education, socioeconomic position and social capital). | | | | | |
| **Quality score⁴:** (++,+ or -) | | | | | | |
| **External validity score:** (++,+ or -) | | | | | | |
