<h1>What kind of systematic review should I conduct? A proposed typology and guidance for systematic reviewers in the medical and health sciences</h1>
<p>The paper presents a novel typology aimed at aiding systematic reviewers in the medical and health sciences to select the most appropriate type of review based on their specific research questions and objectives. Systematic reviews are crucial in synthesizing evidence across various healthcare questions, thereby influencing clinical guidelines and decision-making processes. The proposed typology categorizes systematic reviews into distinct types such as scoping reviews, rapid reviews, full systematic reviews, and mixed-method reviews, each tailored to address different aspects of healthcare questions and methodologies, including effectiveness, experiential outcomes, costs/economics, prevalence/incidence, diagnostic accuracy, and etiology/risk.</p>

<p>The methodology of the paper emphasizes the importance of aligning the review type with the research goals to enhance the clarity and consistency of systematic reviews. Each review type is designed to cater to specific research needs: effectiveness reviews assess the impact of interventions, experiential reviews explore qualitative data on patient experiences, costs/economics reviews analyze financial implications of healthcare interventions, and diagnostic accuracy reviews provide data on the reliability of diagnostic tools. This structured approach ensures that the chosen review type comprehensively addresses the formulated research question, which is supported by mnemonics like PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) for quantitative data and SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) for qualitative data.</p>

<p>The discussion section of the paper highlights the evolution of evidence synthesis over the past three decades, which has seen the introduction of various review types such as integrative, scoping, and rapid reviews. This evolution necessitates a comprehensive taxonomy to aid reviewers in selecting the most appropriate method. The paper also revisits the JBI Model of Evidence-Based Healthcare, emphasizing its cyclical and interconnected nature of evidence generation, synthesis, transfer, and implementation. This model underscores the strategic role of systematic reviews in influencing healthcare policy and practice, and the necessity for rigorous review design to avoid the proliferation of misleading reviews with weak evidence.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the paper underscores the critical role of systematic reviews in synthesizing healthcare literature and influencing healthcare outcomes. By introducing a pioneering typology, the paper provides a framework that assists researchers, policymakers, and funders in selecting the most suitable systematic review approach. This typology not only facilitates the alignment of review methods with research questions but also enhances the effectiveness of evidence synthesis in the medical and health sciences, thereby supporting evidence-based healthcare practices and policy-making.</p>
