4. **Objectives** – Provide an explicit statement of the objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses.

## METHODS

### Eligibility Criteria

5. Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review and how studies were grouped for the syntheses.

### Information Sources

   Specify the date when each source was last searched or consulted.

### Search Strategy

7. Present the full search strategies for all databases, registers and websites, including any filters and limits used.

### Selection Process

8. Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria, how many reviewers screened each record and report, whether they worked independently, and details of automation tools used if applicable.

### Data Collection Process

9. Specify methods used to collect data from reports, including number of reviewers, whether they worked independently, processes for obtaining/confirming data, and any automation tools used.

### Data Items

10a. List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify comprehensiveness of results collection.  
10b. List and define all other variables sought (e.g., participant/intervention characteristics, funding), and assumptions made about missing/unclear data.

### Study Risk of Bias Assessment

11. Specify methods used to assess risk of bias, tools used, number of reviewers, independence, and any automation tools used.

### Effect Measures

12. Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) used (e.g., risk ratio, mean difference).

### Synthesis Methods

13a. Describe processes for deciding study eligibility for each synthesis.  
13b. Describe methods for preparing data (e.g., handling missing data, conversions).  
13c. Describe methods to tabulate/visually display individual study and synthesis results.  
13d. Describe methods to synthesize results, rationale, and meta-analysis models/tools used.  
13e. Describe methods to explore heterogeneity (e.g., subgroup analysis, meta-regression).  
13f. Describe any sensitivity analyses.

### Reporting Bias Assessment

14. Describe methods used to assess risk of bias due to missing results.

### Certainty Assessment

15. Describe methods used to assess certainty (confidence) in the body of evidence.

## RESULTS

### Study Selection

16a. Describe search and selection results, ideally with a flow diagram.  
16b. Cite and explain studies excluded despite apparent eligibility.

### Study Characteristics

17. Cite and describe included studies and their characteristics.

### Risk of Bias in Studies

18. Present risk of bias assessments for each included study.

### Results of Individual Studies

19. Present summary statistics and effect estimates for each outcome/study, ideally in tables or plots.

### Results of Syntheses

20a. Summarize characteristics and bias of contributing studies.  
20b. Present all statistical synthesis results (e.g., summary estimates, precision, heterogeneity).  
20c. Present investigations of heterogeneity causes.  
20d. Present sensitivity analysis results.

### Reporting Biases

21. Present risk of bias due to missing results for each synthesis.

### Certainty of Evidence

22. Present certainty/confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome.

## DISCUSSION

23a. General interpretation of results in context of other evidence.  
23b. Discuss limitations of included evidence.  
23c. Discuss limitations of review processes used.  
23d. Discuss implications for practice, policy, and future research.

24b. Indicate where protocol is accessible or state not prepared.  
24c. Describe and explain protocol amendments.

### Support
