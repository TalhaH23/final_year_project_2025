# STARD 2015 Checklist

## TITLE OR ABSTRACT

1. Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy  
   *(such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC)*

## ABSTRACT

2. Structured summary of study design, methods, results, and conclusions  
   *(for specific guidance, see STARD for Abstracts)*

## INTRODUCTION

3. Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test  
4. Study objectives and hypotheses

## METHODS

### Study Design

5. Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study)

### Participants

6. Eligibility criteria  
7. On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified  
   *(such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry)*  
8. Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates)  
9. Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series

### Test Methods

10a. Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication  
10b. Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication  
11. Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist)  
12a. Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory  
12b. Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory  
13a. Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test  
13b. Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard

### Analysis

14. Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy  
15. How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled  
16. How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled  
17. Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory  
18. Intended sample size and how it was determined

## RESULTS

### Participants

19. Flow of participants, using a diagram  
20. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants  
21a. Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition  
21b. Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition  
22. Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard

### Test Results

23. Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard  
24. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals)  
25. Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard

## DISCUSSION

26. Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability  
27. Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test

## OTHER INFORMATION

28. Registration number and name of registry  
29. Where the full study protocol can be accessed  
30. Sources of funding and other support; role of funders
